# Lab 1
This lab consisted of building the car from scratch, including soldering all the components needed for all PCBs, and connecting the Arduino to the four motors. Then the Arduino was first coded to move the car in a straight line for a certain distance (as shown in the gif below and to the left), then was coded to move the car in a square route of a certain size (as shown in the gif below and to the right) and whose code is shown in `Lab 1/code/Course1.ino`, and finally in a zig-zag shape whose code is shown in `Lab 1/code/Course2.ino`.

# Lab 2
This lab consisted of creating a RF remote to control the vehicle, then installing an accelerometer to the car and sending that information to a screen on the remote, and then install an array of optical sensors to the front of the car so that it could follow a black line on a white surface, as well as being able to switch. Inside the `Lab 2/code` folder, `Car_Code` represents the Arduino code that controls the motors, `Remote_Code` represents the Arduino code for the RF remote, and the `Sensor_Code` represents the Arduino code that sends the accelerometer data to the RF remote.
