# Lab 1
This lab consisted of building the car from scratch, including soldering all the components needed for all PCBs, and connecting the Arduino to the four motors.

Then the Arduino was first coded to move the car in a straight line for a certain distance (as shown in the gif below and to the left), then was coded to move the car in a square route of a certain size (as shown in the gif below and to the right) and whose code is shown in `Lab 1/Course1.ino`, and finally in a zig-zag shape whose code is shown in `Lab 1/Course2.ino`.
